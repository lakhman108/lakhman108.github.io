## About Me

Hey there 👋 I'm Lakhman Parmar, a curious and driven software engineer from Gujarat, India.

I specialize in backend development and love building systems that solve real-world problems — from canteen management and streaming platforms to developer tools and bots. Java, Spring Boot, React, Docker, PostgreSQL — these are my playground.

I believe in **learning in public**, open source collaboration, and tech that empowers people. My roots are grounded in simplicity and self-discipline — I take pride in blending tradition (like caring for cattle) with modern tech.

### Highlights:
- 💻 Developed full-stack projects with Java, Spring Boot, Django, React, and Flutter
- 🚀 Passionate about DevOps, cloud deployments, and automating workflows
- 🧠 Always learning — from adaptive bitrate streaming to test-driven development
- 🌱 Strongly value community, knowledge sharing, and rural innovation
- 📍 Based in Gujarat — building with a global mindset and local heart

> "Code with purpose. Learn with hunger. Build with heart."

Let’s connect and create something meaningful!
